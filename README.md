# News Explorer Application

## Description

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the News Explorer application. My goal of this project was to further my understanding of how to work with databases, build an API, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine.

The News Explorer application provides users with the ability to search for all the news articles over the past week based on a chosen keyword using the News API. A user is also able to sign up, log in, log out, save articles, and access those saved articles if logged in.
